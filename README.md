# ✨ Hello, world! ✨
Welcome to my profile page, I hope you don't mind the mess!

## Who am I? 🤔
I'm an IT student who's currently learning databases and Java.
I spend my free time geeking out about Linux and learning C/C++,
you can tell it by my repos! 

If you are wondering whether I'm human or not, don't worry, I don't know either!

## Check out these repos! 💾

These are the repos I'm most proud of:

- [dotfiles](https://github.com/Kel-05/dotfiles) - Check out my rice!
- [CudaSHA256](https://github.com/Kel-05/CudaSHA256) - A little program I made for [SHAllenge](https://shallenge.quirino.net/)
- [clock](https://github.com/Kel-05/clock) - A TUI clock made in C, considerable as my "coding playground"
